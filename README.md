# Ghana Election Database Project

# Modelling of a Database in SMSS for the 2024 National Presidential and Parliamentary election of Ghana, 2024

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a fully normalized relational database for the Ghana 2024 elections. The database is modeled to store and organize data related to regions, constituencies, polling stations, political parties, candidates, and votes. The objective is to illustrate best practices in database design, specifically normalization, within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## Key Objectives
- Model a normalized database for an election system.
- Use SSMS to create efficient table structures that minimize redundancy.
- Store data for regional hierarchies, candidate details, and voting results.
- Integrate multimedia support to store images for political parties and candidates.


## Database Creation
Before creating tables, we need to set up a database for our project. In SSMS, use the following SQL command to create the database:

![SQL to create the Database](./images/create_database.png)

An alt text you can copy and use.
```sql

CREATE DATABASE GhanaElection2024;

```
This creates the database called `GhanaElection2024` and sets it as the active database for subsequent table creation.


## Database Structure

### Thought Process
The database is designed with full normalization in mind and the aim to reduce redundancy and ensure that each table stores information about a single entity or relationship. Key entities include Regions, Constituencies, PollingStations, Parties, PresidentialCandidates, ParliamentaryCandidates, and Votes. The normalization process is detailed below:

- **First Normal Form (1NF):** Ensures each column contains atomic values.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF):** Removes partial dependencies, where non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF):** Eliminates transitive dependencies by making sure that all non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

## Database Tables

### 1. Regions Table
This table stores data about Ghana's regions, with each region assigned a unique regional ID (`region_id`).

A screenshot of the SQL command I used to create the `Regions Table`
![Regions Table SQL command](./images/regions_table.png)

An alt text you can copy and use.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Regions (
    region_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    region_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

**Code Explanation**

**`CREATE TABLE Regions`:**
- This line creates a table named `Regions`.
- The table will hold information related to Ghana's regions, such as unique identifiers and names.

**`region_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1)`:**
- `region_id`: This column will serve as the unique identifier for each region.
- `INT`: Specifies that `region_id` is of integer data type, which is appropriate for storing numerical values.
- `PRIMARY KEY`: Designates `region_id` as the primary key for the table. This ensures that each entry in the `Regions` table is unique and can be individually accessed.
- `IDENTITY(1,1)`:
  - This keyword is specific to SQL Server and is used to create an auto-incrementing column.
  - The first `1` sets the initial value of `region_id` to 1.
  - The second `1` means that each new entry will increment `region_id` by 1, ensuring a unique ID for every new region added to the table.

**`region_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`:**
- `region_name`: This column stores the name of each region in Ghana.
- `VARCHAR(100)`: This specifies that `region_name` can store variable-length character data, with a maximum of 100 characters. `VARCHAR` is efficient as it only uses as much storage as necessary based on the actual length of the text.
- `NOT NULL`: This constraint ensures that every entry in the `region_name` column must have a value. It prevents regions from being added without a specified name, which is critical for data completeness and consistency.

**Summary:**
This table design serves as a foundational part of the database, as each region in Ghana will be assigned a unique `region_id`, and its name will be stored in `region_name`. This setup enables efficient referencing for regions in other tables through `region_id`, supporting normalized and relational database practices.



### 2. Constituencies Table
This table links constituencies to regions and includes information on voter populations.

A screenshot of the SQL command I used to create the `Constituencies Table`

    constituency_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    region_id INT,
    total_voters INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (region_id) REFERENCES Regions(region_id)
);
```
**Code Explanation**

**`CREATE TABLE Constituencies`:**
- This command initiates the creation of a table called `Constituencies`, which will store information about constituencies in Ghana.

**`constituency_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1)`:**
- `constituency_id`: Serves as a unique identifier for each constituency.
- `INT`: Sets the data type as integer.
- `PRIMARY KEY`: Ensures each constituency has a unique ID.
- `IDENTITY(1,1)`: This auto-increments `constituency_id`, starting at 1 and increasing by 1 with each new entry.

**`constituency_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`:**
- `constituency_name`: Stores the name of each constituency.
- `VARCHAR(100)`: Allows variable-length text with a maximum of 100 characters.
- `NOT NULL`: Ensures every constituency has a name.

**`region_id INT`**:
- `region_id`: References the region in which the constituency is located, linking to the `Regions` table.

**`total_voters INT`**:
- `total_voters`: Stores the total number of registered voters in each constituency.

**`FOREIGN KEY (region_id) REFERENCES Regions(region_id)`:**
- This establishes a foreign key constraint, linking each constituency to a specific region by `region_id`.

**Summary:**
The `Constituencies` table organizes constituencies by assigning each a unique `constituency_id`, storing its name, associated region, and total voter count. This structure supports relationships with the `Regions` table and ensures efficient data organization.

### 3. PollingStations Table
