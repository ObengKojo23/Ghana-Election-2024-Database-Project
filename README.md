Launch the `SSMS` application and click on `New Query` to open the query editor window. 

Use the following SQL command to create a `database`:

A screenshot of the SQL command I used to create the database
![SQL to create the Database](./images/create_database.png)

An alt text you can copy and use.
```sql

CREATE DATABASE GhanaElection2024;

```
This creates the database called `GhanaElection2024` and sets it as the active database for subsequent table creation.


## Database Structure

### Thought Process
The database is designed with full normalization in mind and the aim to reduce redundancy and ensure that each table stores information about a single entity or relationship. Key entities include Regions, Constituencies, PollingStations, Parties, PresidentialCandidates, ParliamentaryCandidates, and Votes. The normalization process is detailed below:

- **First Normal Form (1NF):** Ensures each column contains atomic values.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF):** Removes partial dependencies, where non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF):** Eliminates transitive dependencies by making sure that all non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

## 2. Create Database Tables üóÑÔ∏è

### 2.1 Regions Table
This table stores data about Ghana's regions, with each region assigned a unique regional ID (`region_id`).

A screenshot of the SQL command I used to create the `Regions Table`
![Regions Table SQL command](./images/regions_table.png)

An alt text you can copy and use.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Regions (
    region_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    region_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

**Code Explanation**

**`CREATE TABLE Regions`:**
- This line creates a table named `Regions`.
- The table will hold information related to Ghana's regions, such as unique identifier and region names.

**`region_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1)`:**
- `region_id`: This column will serve as the unique identifier for each region.
- `INT`: Specifies that `region_id` is of integer data type, which is appropriate for storing numerical values.
- `PRIMARY KEY`: Designates `region_id` as the primary key for the table. This ensures that each entry in the `Regions` table is unique and can be individually accessed.
- `IDENTITY(1,1)`:
  - This keyword is specific to SQL Server and is used to create an auto-incrementing column.
  - The first `1` sets the initial value of `region_id` to 1.
  - The second `1` means that each new entry will increment `region_id` by 1, ensuring a unique ID for every new region added to the table.

**`region_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`:**
- `region_name`: This column stores the name of each region in Ghana.
- `VARCHAR(100)`: This specifies that `region_name` can store variable-length character data, with a maximum of 100 characters. `VARCHAR` is efficient as it only uses as much storage as necessary based on the actual length of the text.
- `NOT NULL`: This constraint ensures that every entry in the `region_name` column must have a value. It prevents regions from being added without a specified name, which is critical for data completeness and consistency.

**Summary:**
This table design serves as a foundational part of the database, as each region in Ghana will be assigned a unique `region_id`, and its name will be stored in `region_name`. This setup enables efficient referencing for regions in other tables through `region_id`, supporting normalized and relational database practices.

**Code Explanation**
#### Example: Inserting Mahamudu Bawumia
**Code Explanation**

**`Candidate Name`**: 
   - `'Mahamudu Bawumia'` is inserted into the `candidate_name` column.

**`Party ID`**:
   - The `party_id` for Mahamudu Bawumia is fetched using a subquery:
     ```sql
     (SELECT party_id FROM Parties WHERE party_name = 'New Patriotic Party')
     ```
   - This subquery retrieves the `party_id` corresponding to the `'New Patriotic Party'` from the `Parties` table. The candidate is linked to this party.

**`Candidate Image`**:
   - The profile image for Mahamudu Bawumia is inserted as a binary object (BLOB) using the `OPENROWSET` function:
     ```sql
     (SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\img\flag_bearers\Bawumia.png', SINGLE_BLOB) AS Image)
     ```
   - The image is read from the file path `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\img\flag_bearers\Bawumia.png` on the server and inserted into the database.

#### Repeated Structure for Other Presidential Candidates

The same structure as shown for Mahamudu Bawumia is repeated for each of the other presidential candidates. For each candidate:

- Their **name** is inserted into the `candidate_name` column.
- Their **party ID** is retrieved using a subquery that finds the `party_id` from the `Parties` table.
- Their **profile image** is inserted as a binary large object (BLOB) using the `OPENROWSET` function, which reads the image file from the server.

**Summary**

This method ensures:
- **`Linking to Political Parties`**: Each candidate is linked to their respective political party through the `party_id` column, ensuring the correct association between candidates and their parties.
- **`Efficient Image Storage`**: The profile image of each candidate is stored as a binary large object (BLOB), which allows for efficient storage of image data directly in the database without needing separate image hosting solutions.


### 4.2 Inserting Party Names, Abbreviations, and Flags into the Parties Table

This SQL code inserts data into the `Parties` table for various political parties and their associated information. Specifically, it inserts the following details:

**`Party Name`**: The full name of the political party.
**`Party Abbreviation`**: The abbreviated name or acronym of the political party.
**`Party Flag`**: The party's flag image, which is stored as a binary large object (BLOB) using the `OPENROWSET` function.

        (SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\img\party_flags\KOFI_IND.png', SINGLE_BLOB) AS Image));
```
**Code Explanation**

The structure of each `INSERT INTO` statement is similar for all parties:

- **`Party Name`**: The name of the political party.
- **`Party Abbreviation`**: A short version or acronym of the party's name.
- **`Party Flag Image`**: The flag of the party, stored as a binary large object (BLOB) by using `OPENROWSET` to read the image file stored on the SQL server.

**Summary**

This method ensures:
- **`Correct Party Information`**: Each political party is inserted with its full name, abbreviation, and flag image, allowing easy identification of parties.
- **`Efficient Image Storage`**: The flag images are stored as BLOBs, ensuring that the images are stored directly within the database, making it easy to retrieve and display the flags when needed without relying on external file storage.
